## Mickey 2.0 explanation

The Mickey class has several attributes. That is, state representing the state of Mickey 2.0, iv representing the initialization vector, and ivIndex representing the index of the initialization vector currently in use. This class contains a Mickey() constructor used to initialize a Mickey object with a key and an IV, an encrypt() method used to perform encryption, and a There are also some methods such as the decrypt() method used for

The init() method of the Mickey class is used to initialize the state with the key and IV. The generateKeystreamByte() method is used to generate bytes from a keystream using the Mickey 2.0 algorithm. The encrypt() method uses generateKeystreamByte() to generate the keystream and XOR each data byte with the resulting keystream byte to generate the ciphertext bytes. The decrypt() method performs the same operation as encrypt(), so it can decrypt ciphertext to plaintext. The Mickey class uses the uint8_t and uint32_t data types from the stdint.h library. There is also a definition of the MICKEY_IV_SIZE constant used to determine the IV size. In that implementation, each attribute and method of the Mickey class has private or public access depending on its function.Â
